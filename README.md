Overview
This repository contains all the resources needed to:

Model a multi-joint robotic arm in SolidWorks

Assemble and animate the arm mechanism

Simulate the armâ€™s kinematics and dynamics in MATLAB

The goal is to provide a learning platform for students and engineers interested in robotics, mechanical design, and control systems.

Features
Parametric 3D modeling of a robotic arm in SolidWorks

Assembly and motion analysis in CAD

MATLAB scripts for simulating forward and inverse kinematics, as well as dynamic response

Reference tutorials and links for further learning

Getting Started
Prerequisites
SolidWorks (2018 or later recommended)

MATLAB (with Robotics Toolbox preferred)

CAD Model References
To guide you through the modeling and assembly process, refer to these detailed tutorials:

Robotic Arm in SolidWorks | 3D Modeling and Assembly (YouTube Playlist)

SolidWorks Tutorial #306: Gripper (YouTube Video)

These resources cover the step-by-step process of building each component, assembling the robotic arm, and animating its movement.

MATLAB Simulations
Add links to your MATLAB simulation scripts or demonstration videos here.

Briefly describe the purpose of each simulation (e.g., forward kinematics, trajectory planning, control algorithms).

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new simulations to add, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
